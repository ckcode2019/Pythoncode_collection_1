# programing task --
# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13
print("Mathematical operations on 22 and 13 \n")
# Print the result of 13 added to 22
print(f"22 + 13 is: { 22 + 12} \n")
# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22
print(f"22 - 13 is: { 22 - 13} \n")
# Print the result of 22 multiplied by 13
print(f"22 * 13 is: { 22 * 13} \n")
# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)
print(f"22 / 13 is: { 22 / 13} \n")
# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13
print(f"22 // 13 is: { 22 // 13} \n")
# Print the remainder of 22 divided by 13
print(f"22 % 13 is: { 22 - 13} \n")
